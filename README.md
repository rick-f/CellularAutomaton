# CellularAutomaton

An MVC-format, general-use framework for creating and displaying Cellular Automata.

Conventions:

For Java source code: follow Google style guide (can I conform, but w/ more whitespace?)

For Git commit messages: follow Chris Beams' article "How to Write a Git Commit Message"

	Seven rules of a great commit message--from Chris Beams

    1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    3. Capitalize the subject line
    4. Do not end the subject line with a period
    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

For project directory structure: follow Maven standards
